\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of testing Pong Invaders is, at its core, to ensure that
the game meets all its requirements whether technical, functional, or usablilityrelated.


\subsection{Scope}
The scope of the project is a two phase project, that our team
believes to be moderately complex. Phase one is Space Invaders, while phase two
in Pong. Once both are completed the games can be merged into Pong Invaders.
With our workflow being split into two phases, our team can test functionality
in parallel. This also allows our team to ensure working subsystems of Space
Invaders, and Pong prior to Pong Invaders being created. Once testing is
complete for the subsystems, all that would remain to be tested - once Pong
Invaders is created - are merge conflicts which would be trivial to test for by
unit testing.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
The purpose of this document is to describe the overall test plan on
how testing for Pong Invaders is to be conducted. The following test plan
described in this document will provide what framework will be used to test
Pong Invaders, as well as the test cases that will be examined.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
Pong Invaders is written in Java, and is a game that takes mouse or keyboard as
inputs. For output the game displays the game state and graphics to the display.
The keyboard input will be used to move the ship in the game, navigate through
menus, and fire bullets. The mouse input will be used as well if the player so
desires, as the controls in game can be rebounded to the mouse. The functions of
the software that are to be tested are the: window, collision, keyinput, menu,
player, bullet and alien functions. The window function handles the window
creation when the game is started, collision handles all detection of sprites
with one another, keyinput handles whether a key has been pressed and what to do
when that key is pressed, menu handles the main menu game state, player handles
the ship functionality and how it moves, bullet handles how the ship fires
bullets and how they are drawn, and lastly the alien function handles how the
aliens are drawn on the screen and their A.I.

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}
		
\paragraph{Menu and Peripherals Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: Manual 
					
Initial State: Active Game State 
					
Input: Mouse Movement 
					
Output: Real-Time Mouse Coordinates 
					
How test will be performed: With the game in an active running state, the
program will be set to print the mouse coordinates whenever the mouse is moved.
The mouse will be moved to the boundaries of the screen and it will be checked
that the coordinates are equal to the screen length and width of the screen when
respectively checked.
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: Manual 
					
Initial State: Active Game State 
					
Input: Keyboard inputs
					
Output: Playable character Movement
					
How test will be performed: The game will be put in an active state and it will
be checked that all pre-set keys are functioning and the correct output is given
in game. For example if the left and right arrow keys are the key bindings for
ship movement then the ship should move on screen when keyboard input is given.


\item{test-id3\\}

Type: Manual
					
Initial State: Active Game State
					
Input: Keyboard and mouse inputs 
					
Output: Correct Menu option is followed 
					
<<<<<<< HEAD
How test will be performed: The game will be put in an active state and it will
be checked that all pre-set keys are functioning and the correct output is given
in game. For example if the left and right arrow keys are the key bindings for
ship movement then the ship should move on screen when keyboard input is given.
=======
How test will be performed: The game will be put in an active menu state and the menu screeen will be used to traverse different menu options. The Play now option will be checked to start the game. Followed by the how to play option which should display a how to play guide. Finally a re-binding option should be given so that the player can re-bind input keys for personal preference during play. 


\item{test-id4\\}

Type: Manual

Initial State: Active Game State 

Input: Keyboard inputs

Output: Playable character Movement

How test will be performed: The game will be put in an active state and the user will re-bind their keys to a more personal fit. The keys will then be checked to function correctly based on binding.

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

This is a section that would be appropriate for some teams.
